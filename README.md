# üóÇÔ∏è SQL Analysis of Socioeconomic, Public School, and Crime Data in Chicago (2008-2012)

## üîé Introduction
This project involves exploring three key datasets from the City of Chicago‚Äôs Data Portal: socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and crime data. The goal is to perform data analysis using SQL queries to uncover insights about the relationships between socioeconomic factors, school performance, and crime across different community areas in Chicago from 2008 to 2012.

## üìä Data Overview
The analysis is based on three datasets:
1. **Socioeconomic Indicators (2008-2012)**: Contains six socioeconomic indicators and a hardship index for Chicago‚Äôs 77 community areas.
2. **Chicago Public Schools (2011-2012)**: School-level performance data from the 2011-2012 academic year.
3. **Chicago Crime Data (2001-present)**: Crime incidents reported in Chicago, with a focus on a subset of the data for analysis.

## üéØ Objectives
1. Investigate crime rates and trends across Chicago.
2. Examine the socioeconomic conditions of Chicago‚Äôs community areas and their relationship to crime.
3. Analyze school performance, particularly in relation to safety scores and college enrollment rates.
4. Determine correlations between school safety and community socioeconomic factors.

2. **Table Creation**: Create tables for Chicago public schools, socioeconomic data, and crime data.
3. **Data Insertion**: Insert data from the three datasets into their respective tables.
4. **SQL Queries**: Write SQL queries to analyze trends, uncover patterns, and extract meaningful insights.

## üìà Analysis
- **Total Crimes Recorded**: Calculate the total number of crimes recorded.
- **Crime Data Overview**: Retrieve the first 10 rows from the crime data.
- **Arrest-Related Crimes**: Analyze the number of crimes that involve arrests.
- **Gas Station Crimes**: Identify unique crime types recorded at gas stations.
- **Community Areas with 'B'**: List community areas whose names start with the letter 'B'.
- **Healthy Schools**: Identify schools in community areas 10 to 15 that are healthy school certified.
- **Average School Safety Score**: Calculate the average school safety score.
- **Top Community Areas by College Enrollment**: Determine the top 5 community areas by average college enrollment.
- **Community Area with Lowest Safety Score**: Use sub-queries to find the community area with the lowest school safety score.
- **Per Capita Income and School Safety**: Find the per capita income for the community area with the lowest safety score without using an explicit join.

## üîë Key Insights
- The distribution of crime types across different community areas.
- Relationship between community socioeconomic conditions and crime rates.
- Correlation between school safety scores and socioeconomic factors like per capita income.
- Insights into which community areas have the highest college enrollment rates and how safety scores affect school performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Techniques
- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing the datasets.
- **MySQL Database**: To store and manage the datasets.
- **Data Portal**: Source of publicly available data on Chicago.
- **Python**: For further analysis and visualization (if needed).

## üìä Results
- Extracted trends from the crime data, identifying areas with high crime rates.
- Found socioeconomic indicators linked to low school safety scores and low per capita income.
- Identified top-performing schools based on college enrollment.

## üîç Conclusion
The project provides valuable insights into the relationships between socioeconomic conditions, school safety, and crime in Chicago. Through SQL queries, we have uncovered patterns that can guide decision-making for policymakers and educational authorities.

## Future Directions
- Explore the effects of post-2012 changes in socioeconomic indicators on crime and education.
- Conduct longitudinal studies to see how safety initiatives impact school performance over time.
- Further integration of Python and Power BI for more advanced visualizations and reporting.
